First, we need to install Parameterized Trigger Plugin 

Once this plugin is installed , go to Job 1(upstream job) > Post-Build Actions > Select ”Trigger parameterized build on other projects”

Then we will choose the options from the GUI plugin.

After that, we need to send the ‘Build_Number’ of this job to the next. So we will assign it to a variable ‘Temp’.

The complete list of Jenkins Environment Variables are seen here.

In the Downstream Job: To access this parameter we must define our passed parameter (Temp in the example) as a parameterized build parameter in the 
downstream job before the parameter will be passed.
